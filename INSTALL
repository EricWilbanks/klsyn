* Prerequisites

    python -- both 2.6 and 2.7 seem to work.

    Cython
    numpy
    scipy.io.wavfile

    If compiling from source, a C compiler is also necessary.


* Installing

    This command compiles the C extension and python modules and
    copies the modules and scripts to the system Python installation:

      python setup.py install


* Packaging as a standalone executable

    The klattsyn.py script can be compiled as an executable with pyinstaller.

    First, pyinstaller must be installed. pywin32 might be necessary as
    well on Windows systems.

    Second, install the klsyn package with setup.py as described above.

    Finally, run pyinstaller from the klsyn source root directory. It might
    be necessary to add the path location of the klsyn package, e.g.:

      pyinstaller --paths=/c/Python27/Lib/site-package/ --onefile scripts/klattsyn.py

    This example worked with a Windows 7 system with the MinGW compiler, and
    the command was run from a Git Bash shell.


* Troubleshooting

    [Problem from 20131125]

    Note for building under Windows using MinGW, run the above in a
    MinGW shell. If you get the error "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"
    it might be necessary to provide the hint that mingw32 is the
    compiler to use by editing (or creating) distutils.cfg for your
    version of python (e.g. C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg)
    and adding the section:

    [build]
    compiler=mingw32

    Newer versions of cygwin do not recognize the -mno-cygwin option to
    gcc, and for these versions you can edit
    C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\cygwincompiler.py and remove references
    to -mno-cygwin.
    
    [Problem from 20131127]

    On a Windows system compiled with mingw, the klatt_wrap extension
    intermittently failed to load with:

    ImportError: DLL load failed: Invalid access to memory location

    The problem was resolved by upgrading from gcc 4.4.3 to 4.8.1. For
    context and additional solutions see:
